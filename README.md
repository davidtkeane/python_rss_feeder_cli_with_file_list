# python_rss_feeder_cli_with_file_list
This script includes a menu that allows you to choose which functionality to use. The script also includes the ability to load RSS feed URLs from a CSV file, select a specific URL to display, or display a random URL. If the 'rss_feed' directory or 'rss_feed.csv' file do not exist, they will be created when the script is run.
